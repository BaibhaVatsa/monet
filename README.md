# BIPL
A Basic Inspired Programming Language

This is my attempt at writing a language. While it will be a simple one, I am just doing this to learn and maybe make a useful scripting tool. Ultimately, I have no plans for this except learning from it.

The syntax is similar to BASIC. Syntax is always 
`command parameter`. A function can have an arbitrary number of parameters. Commands and functions are case insensitive

Built in commands so far:
`print`, `println`, `string`, `boolean`, `num`
